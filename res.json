It thrives on neglect, responding best to the lightest of watering and then just being left alone. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer, but that's about as much special attention as it needs.It's a great bedroom plant as it stores up oxygen throughout the day, then releases it all at night.Low-key as it is, the snake plant has long been treasured all over the world. In Nigeria, it's associated with Ogun, the deity of war. In other parts of Africa, it's connected to Oya, the bringer of storms. In China, it's the ‘Tiger’s tail orchid’; in Japan, the ‘Tiger’s tail’; in Brazil, the ‘Sword of Saint George’; in Russia, ‘Pike’s tail’. Basically, this plant is pretty famous.For more very easy plants, check out our Unkillables range. \n\nAnother nickname for this plant is ‘Viper’s bowstring hemp’, because its strong fibres were once used to make strings for bows."]

The island gives the palm its botanical name, Howea forsteriana. It’s a slow grower that can take decades to reach its maximum height of 10 metres.In the 1870s, the Kentia palm came to the UK. The Victorians loved an exotic status symbol and grew it as a houseplant. It coped bravely with the poor light and air in Victorian homes. Queen Victoria herself was a big fan, insisting palms were placed around her coffin when she died.This is still an incredibly popular houseplant, but now we can give it a much better life. It has simple needs. It likes lots of bright light, but not harsh direct sun. Regular misting will keep its leaves fresh and green. It will also appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. It’s a royal favourite. It deserves respect.\n\nKentia palms were used for decoration on The Titanic.

In fact, it’s very hard to come by anywhere. This extraordinary plant is the result of some very careful cultivation. It’s so rare and so prized that plants have been known to exchange hands for thousands of pounds.The reason it doesn’t appear in the wild is because the plant naturally wants to be all green. The white variegation makes it more delicate. The green parts of the leaf contain chlorophyll, which allows plants to absorb light, which they turn into energy. The white parts contain no chlorophyll. So variegated plants have to work harder to live.This is still a very happy plant, it just requires a little more care to keep it healthy. Because it absorbs light less efficiently, it needs lots of it (but not direct sun). If you don’t have ample light, the all-green Monstera, Chaz, is an ideal alternative. It can happily live in semi-shade.If you have the right conditions for the variegated variety, you are in for a treat.

Your plant will just suck up all the water it needs. You’ve probably read our guidance saying plants don’t like their roots too wet, but that only applies to plants growing in soil.

You get four beautiful plants in a variety of sizes, with very different leaf shapes and patterns. They’re all from our (Almost) Unkillable range, which means they’re really easy to look after.You could group them together for a stunning display, or spread them around your home. They’ll be happy in any room that gets some natural light. They’re all tolerant of drought, but try to water them when the top two inches of soil feel dry. The set without pots includes:Chaz - The monstera, or cheese plant, is a classic. Those notched leaves compliment any room. He’ll grow quickly in a bright room but he’ll be fine in light shade. Please be aware that those distinctive leaf holes appear as the plant grows. The leaves on young plants may be hole-less.Pippa - The peace lily is as strong as she is beautiful. Her big dark green leaves are joined by simple white flowers in spring. You’ll know when it’s time to water her because her leaves will flop, then quickly perk up after a drink. Please note that while she’ll be happy in shade she’ll produce a lot more flowers in brighter light.Susie - Her long, slender leaves earned her the common name snake plant. She has a really stylish sculptural shape that works in any interior. And she really will live anywhere. She hardly ever needs watering and she’ll work with whatever light you have, from shade to sunshine.Rick - The corn plant looks a little bit like a miniature palm tree, with a slender trunk and stiff, glossy leaves. Unlike a palm tree, he doesn’t need much sun to survive. He grows tall and slim, so he’s ideal for small spaces.The set with pots also includes:Fracture pot - Layers of glaze give this luxurious pot its distinctive texture. This is a pot for your very best plants. They're exclusive to Patch.Concrete pot - Clean design and honest materials. That’s what these minimalist concrete pots are all about. When the design is this simple, the finish has to be perfect. They're exclusive to Patch.Dipped pot - A strip of the original sand glaze is left exposed, creating the contrast that makes these so beautiful. In cream, they add gentle colour to your room. They're exclusive to Patch.Ceramic glazed pot - Hand-moulded clay pots are painted with a special glaze that forms a fine crackled finish as it’s fired.

It gets its popular name because its leaves look very similar to those of a banana tree, not because it bears any yellow fruit.Its other, more fitting, nickname is white bird of paradise, because of the enormous, exotic flowers that bloom on very mature plants in the wild. It’s rare for plants to flower indoors, but it is possible. If you’d like a flowering bird of paradise, we recommend Nicolau’s cousin Reggie.In the wild, this plant grows on hot, coastal parts of Africa and Mexico. It likes to bask in full sun, so when growing it at home keep it somewhere that enjoys lots of natural light and doesn’t get too cold. It’s a fast grower, so may need repotting about every three years. It will also benefit from a feed with a liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. It's a big plant that needs food to grow. \n\n It takes a very long time for wild bananas to flower. Typically a plant won’t bloom until it’s at least six years old."]

When you do water it, make sure to let all the excess run out of the bottom of the pot, so as not to waterlog it. It will cope with neglect - the odd missed watering; minimal light - a lot better than most plants. If you like a plant that’s easygoing and sculptural, look no further.Give it an extra growth boost by feeding it with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. \n\nIn various parts of Tanzania, the juice of the ZZ plant is used to treat earache, inflammation and ulceration.

And isn’t it just. The monster part is likely because of its huge, glossy leaves. The delicious part is because in the wild it bears (apparently) very tasty fruit.The reason its leaves have all those holes is because it’s used to growing in jungle shade. It’s an epiphyte, which means it grows in crevices in large trees. The gaps in its leaves allow the available light to reach the lowest foliage. The holes in the leaves develop as the plant grows larger. If you order the smallest, youngest plant, it may arrive without the signature notches in all its leaves. They'll appear as it matures.With its gorgeous foliage it’s a real statement piece, wherever you put it. It’s not hard to take care of and is tolerant of surprisingly low light. It will also love you if you give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once a month in spring and summer. It will help it grow big and strong.Please note that the 110-120cm Swiss cheese plant comes with a moss pole for support (physical, not emotional). The 90-100cm plant has been trained so that it has especially dense foliage. It may not be as tall as its largest brother, but as you can see, it's extra leafy.\n\nWhen it grows really large, the Swiss cheese plant grows long, aerial roots.

Whatever you choose to call it, it’s an excellent house guest. A bright place to live and water when it’s dry are all it asks (by the way, don't worry when it loses its lower leaves as it grows - it's totally normal). It will also thank you for a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser in spring and summer (dilute the feed to half strength as it doesn't like its drinks strong).This one’s a winner.

Growing a schefflera on lava looks very elegant and makes it very easy to look after. The schefflera’s roots have grown around the lava, a porous stone. As the lava absorbs water from the tray, the plant sucks water from the lava. Try to keep the tray about three-quarters full. If any roots grow down and touch the surface of the water, trim them with scissors. It will stop the plant sucking up too much water and turning yellow.If you need to move your schefflera, always be sure to lift it by the tray, not the lava rock, to avoid damaging the rock or the plant. Every piece of lava rock is unique, so the one you receive will differ from the one in the pictures. Over time, you may see light white marks or green algae appear on the rock. This can look beautiful, but if you'd rather remove it you can do so by lightly scrubbing with a toothbrush (best not the one you're currently using).\n\nIt’s not just lava rocks the plant will grow on.

All it asks is a fairly bright spot in your home and an occasional drink.The money tree is known by many lovely names: French peanut, Guiana nut, Malabar chestnut, provision tree, monguba, pumpo. Or to botanists, pachira aquatica. It’s usually found growing in swamps in Central and South America. It’s plaited trunk doesn’t occur naturally, but it’s become traditional to plait it when grown as a houseplant. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, this plant is believed to bring good fortune and prosperity. In Asia, it’s become very popular as an office plant, as it’s thought it will help a business thrive. Got to be worth a try, right?This plant does well in both home or office. It just likes to live somewhere light, though out of direct sun, and to be watered when the top two inches of soil feel dry. It also likes to be misted occasionally. Look after it and in return it might make you rich, hopefully.\n\nIt’s believed that the tradition for plaiting this plant’s trunk started in the 1980s, when a Taiwanese truck driver decided they looked better that way."]

It’s one of only two palms native to Europe and copes happily with British weather. Cold temperatures, wind and drought won’t phase it. In the wild, it grows mainly in southwestern Europe, in places like Spain and Portugal, but also in North Africa. It’s quite a slow grower, but in the wild it can reach heights of up to 5m, with its fan-like leaves growing as long as 1.5m. It won’t reach those heights in a pot and will only grow a few centimetres per year, so don’t worry about it taking over your balcony or patio.It’s incredibly easy to care for. It likes a spot that gets some sun, but is fine with shade for part of the day. It’s very drought tolerant so just give it a water occasionally, when you notice the top two inches of soil are dry. Your plant will arrive in a nursery pot (the plastic pot it’s been growing in). There’s no need to remove it from this. Just place the whole thing inside a decorative pot. This is an ideal plant for inexperienced gardeners and gives great results for very little effort. We’re big fans. \n\nIn Spain, dwarf palm seeds are mainly spread by badgers, which are attracted to the fruit that smells like rancid butter."]

It makes its home in the crevices of tall trees (scientifically, it’s known as an epiphyte). It dangles handsomely soaking up moisture from the atmosphere.In the wild, it gets most of its required water and nutrients from the air. Remembering that is a good way to understand how to care for it. Don’t water it too frequently, but mist it regularly. Basically, do your best impression of a tropical rainforest. As it’s used to living in the shade of the forest, it doesn’t need much light. If you’re not a confident plant parent yet, it’s a very easy option. Remember to also give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. This plant also comes in a variegated option, if you like your leaves a little jazzier be sure to check out Theodora.\n\nIt is sometimes known as Shingle plant, because its overlapping leaves look a bit like roof shingles."]

Don’t panic that you’re going to need to smash a hole in your roof. Our indoor version is much more compact.With its abundance of dark green glossy leaves it makes a very stylish houseplant. It’s pretty simple to take care of too. It will tolerate lower light, but prefers bright, indirect light, and just asks that it not be allowed to dry out. You can also encourage it to grow more strongly by giving it a feed with plant fertiliser once a month in spring and summer.In the wild it will bear small orange-red edible fruit, but don’t expect yours to fruit indoors. Enjoy it for its leafy handsomeness.If it sheds some leaves shortly after delivery, don't worry. It's just its way of adjusting to new light and temperature levels. A bit of leaf drop throughout the year is normal, especially in winter. It has so many leaves that it can spare losing a few.\n\nThe ficus is the official tree of Bangkok. We are not sure what benefits this title affords it, to be honest."]

They’re succulents, which means they can store large amounts of water to keep them alive through long droughts.They rarely have leaves, because leaves mean moisture loss. Instead many have developed hard spikes, which both minimise evaporation and keep pesky animals away. A small cactus is a great starter plant or gift because it’s so easy to care for. It will tolerate lower light conditions, but thrives in sun, and needs very little water. Cacti would much much rather be too dry than too wet. Try to make yours think it's in the desert.Please note that your cactus will arrive in a nursery pot. We have lots of plant pots available to make them look even smarter. \n\nCacti are so resilient that they can even be found on the driest desert on Earth, the Atacama desert."]

This classic houseplant will live happily in anything from quite bright light to shady corners and it only needs watering when its leaves flop over. It’s incredibly easy. Oh, but the name peace lily is actually due to its pure white flowers.This one differs from the classic peace lily because it has variegated leaves, striped with green and cream. It’s just as easy to care for as its fully green sister, and equally as lovely. The peace lily is native to tropical rainforests, specifically those of South and Central America. It’s thought it was brought to Europe some time in the late 1800s. It’s been popular as a houseplant ever since because of its easy-going nature.Despite the name, it’s not actually a lily at all and the white ‘flower’ isn’t a flower. The white part is called a spathe and its job is to attract pollinators. The flowers are actually tiny little things on that yellow spike, or spadix, in the centre of the spathe. Flowers can appear all year, if it gets enough light. When flowers wilt, cut them off at the base. This will encourage new flowers to take their place.\n\nIn the Chinese art of feng shui, peace lilies are considered an aura purifier.

It’s actually a vine and will climb up trees and through the canopy to reach the sun. Wild versions can grow to 20 metres or more. That’s not the really interesting part. As this plant ages, its leaves change completely. Young leaves have the distinctive arrow shape, but as they mature they begin to separate and become multi-lobed (that means they’re divided into several ‘fingers’). Leaves high up a stem can look totally different from those at the bottom. You’d have to let a houseplant version get really big to reach the multi-lobed stage, but there’s a challenge for you. There are many syngonium varieties. Neon robusta is easily one of the most beautiful, with dusky pink leaves that add stylish colour to any room. It’s very easy to care for as a houseplant. If you give it a nice bright spot, away from direct sun, it can grow pretty quickly. You can either let it trail - it would look amazing on a high bedroom shelf - or trim it back to keep it compact. It will be very happy either way. Giving it a monthly feed in spring and summer will help it grow healthily.\n\nAnother common name for this plant is ‘goosefoot’.

It gets its name from the white latex coursing through its veins, which was once used to make rubber. Way back in 1400BC, the Mesoamerican people would mix latex from the rubber plant with juice from a Morning glory plant to make bouncy balls, which they used in a game called ollamaliztil. In English the game is known as pok-a-tok. Sadly, the rules are lost to history.The rubber plant is not often used for its latex these days. It’s much more popular as a houseplant, loved for its thick, rubbery leaves. Those big leaves like a lot of light. Direct sun can be too harsh, but lots of indirect light will make this ex-sports star very happy. It will also appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.If you’d prefer this plant with dark green leaves, check out Rob’s brother Robin.\n\nIn parts of India, the rubber tree’s incredibly strong roots have been trained to form ‘living bridges’ over small rivers."]

It likes moist air that echoes its forest home, so regular misting is a good idea. It also loves a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.

In summer, put yours in the sunniest spot you have. It likes a lot of water. If it’s allowed to dry out the fruit will be much smaller. If the weather gets very hot you may need to water it every couple of days but once or twice a week will usually be fine. Make sure excess water can drain freely from the bottom of the pot. Although it loves sun, this is a surprisingly tough plant. It can cope in temperatures just below freezing, but in winter it’s best to move it somewhere warmer. Inside your house, near a window, is great. If you have a greenhouse, even better. It will need very little water in winter. Just enough to keep the soil lightly moist.Fruit can take about six months to ripen fully, but you don’t have to wait that long. A fully ripe lime will be light yellow and almost sweet. The sharp, green limes we’re all used to are actually under-ripe, so feel free to pick them when they’re still green but nice and plump.Depending on the time of year, your tree may arrive without fruit, but if you give it enough warmth and sun it should flower and fruit from spring.\n\nAbout 19.4 million tons of limes are consumed around the world every year."]

There is a whole lot more to know about bamboo. There are over 1,000 different bamboo species, growing natively on every continent except Europe. They almost all have hollow stems, grow in dense clumps and many grow very, very quickly. Some species are known to grow at a rate of almost 4cm per hour. Yes, per hour. This one, umbrella bamboo, is a lot slower than that, but still a quick grower. Bamboo likes to grow in quite moist soil and loves sun, though it will also do well in partial shade. This species is very leafy, as well as tall, and its canes arc gently. It makes a lovely backdrop for other plants and is also very useful as a screen, because of its dense growth. Use it to hide any unattractive parts of your outdoor space, or as a way to divide your garden, or to create privacy on balconies.Because it grows quickly, you’ll probably want to thin him out each year by chopping out older growth. It's also better grown in pots rather than in the ground as it does have a habit of taking over as much of the garden as it can.\n\nBamboo is significant in the mythologies of a number of Asian countries. In Phillipine mythology the first man and woman emerged from a stem of bamboo."]

As it’s used to living in the shade of the forest, it doesn’t need much light. If you’re not a confident plant parent yet, it’s a very easy option. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer, but that's about as much special attention as it needs.If you like the plant but would prefer the leaves entirely green, may we recommend Theodore.\n\nSome dischidia live on ant nests and have evolved so that their leaves are the perfect shape for sheltering the little critters."]

It’s a stunning plant. In the wild, you’d find this plant in the tropical forests of Brazil, where it grows about 30cm tall. It loves humidity (spray it regularly with a mister) but it likes its soil to stay quite dry. Only water it when it’s dry to a depth of at least two inches. Like most highly patterned plants, it needs lots of light to look its best, although avoid direct sun, which can fade it. A monthly feed with liquid fertiliser in spring and summer will also be greatly appreciated. \n\nAlthough it looks very much like a calathea, they’re actually different plant families."]

Eventually, it becomes a strange, bulbous tree. Often it will flower and grow round, red fruit.As a houseplant it won’t become a tree, or grow flowers and fruit (we don’t have the necessary conditions). It will remain a tall, handsome plant that deals very well with living inside. When caring for it, think desert: Lots and lots of light; not a lot of water. Please be aware that Ian's sap is poisonous. It can cause a rash if it gets on your skin and it's highly toxic if consumed. We don't recommend him for homes with small children or curious pets.\n\nThe milky latex inside it is poisonous, but some indigenous groups in Africa have learned how to turn it into a medicine for a variety of ailments."]

The bright red flowers emerge from little tubes, so they look like lipsticks twisting out of their holders.You should see flowers if you put your plant somewhere that gets a good amount of bright light, but not direct sunlight. Keep its soil lightly moist and give it a regular squirt with a mister. It’s also a good idea to feed it once per month in spring and summer. Follow those instructions and you should see lots of flowers. Even when it’s not in flower, this plant is a beauty, whether it’s a hanging plant or cascading its bright green leaves from a high shelf.\n\nMost lipstick plants are pollinated not by bees but by stunning sunbirds.

This one, ‘White Forest Flame’, has snow-white veins for striking contrast.Fittonias come from the South American rainforest, where they cover the ground with their lovely colour. Because they’re rainforest plants, they love moist conditions and a medium level of light. They do best if they’re kept in moist soil and given regular misting to keep the air humid. They’re also a perfect plant for a terrarium, where they’ll thrive in the warm, moist air.Fittonias will always stay small – they’ll eventually reach about 15cm tall – but you can help them grow healthily by giving them a dose of plant food once per month in spring and summer. If you want to keep them really small and bushy, just snip back any long growth whenever you want.\n\nFittonias are sometimes known as the ‘nerve plant’, because their veins look (a bit) like the human nervous system."]

We think this version is the most spectacular, with beautiful green variegation on the upper side of the leaf and a deep, autumnal purple underneath. In its natural habitat it will grow little white flowers. Those are very unlikely to appear in plant living indoors, but it hardly needs them. This plant is already an absolute showstopper. To keep your plant happy, give it a spot somewhere that gets a medium level of light and water it whenever the top two inches of soil feel dry. You should also give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once a month in spring and summer.\n\nToo much sun can actually make this plant’s colours fade, so try to keep it away from very sunny windows."]

That makes it a great choice for smaller spaces.Like its cousin, ficus altissima is a ‘strangler fig’. It starts its life growing in the branches of larger trees, then slowly grows down toward the ground, twisting around its host’s trunk as it goes. Eventually it completely envelops the host tree, killing it. All quite dramatic, but appropriately so for such a striking plant. It won’t strangle anything in your home. It will just look lovely, if you give it lots of light and keep it regularly watered and misted. It will also benefit from a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser in spring and summer. \n\nA wild ficus altissima can reach heights of up to 30 metres."]

Anthurium adreanum lives in rainforests, either in the branches of larger trees or on the ground beneath them. That means it’s used to getting dappled light, rather than direct sun, and regularly getting soaked by rainfall.In a home, that means giving it indirect light and making sure its soil is kept lightly moist. You'll help it grow, and encourage flowers, by feeding it with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.\n\nThere are over 1,000 different varieties of anthurium.

The plants were gifted to William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, who had them cultivated in his greenhouses and then named them after himself. Well, why wouldn’t you?They now grow all over the world, in places with lots of sun and humidity. This particular species is known as the dwarf Cavendish because it doesn’t grow very tall, maxing out at around three metres. It’s unlikely to even get as tall as that as an indoor plant, but it’s still a very large plant. Its leaves are enormous, so it’s a good one for homes with lots of space.The dwarf Cavendish is a fast grower in the right conditions. It likes a lot of light and will even be happy with some direct sun throughout the day. Let its soil dry out a little between waterings, but make sure to keep it regularly misted as those giant leaves need a lot of moisture. You can help it grow healthily by giving it a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.Don’t worry if you ever see tears in its leaves. Because of their size, they can be fairly easy to damage, but it grows so quickly that it will soon replace any broken growth. Please note that despite the name, this banana tree won’t fruit. You’d need a considerably hotter house for that.\n\nCavendish bananas are the most popular banana in the world."]

Even if you don’t eat the fruit, it will look really pretty on a patio or balcony. Like most citrus plants, it loves lots of sun, so put it in your brightest spot. It likes its soil to be kept moist, which may mean watering its soil every couple of days at the height of summer. In colder months it may only need watering every couple of weeks. Leaves will provide fragrance year round, with flowers appearing in spring and summer. Fruit will follow, taking up to six months to ripen. Feeding at least once a month will encourage fruiting. As well as cooking, the fruit and its juice can also be used as a substitute for lime in cocktails. Top tip: You can freeze the fruit whole and use it when you need it. Citrus trees can be damaged by very cold temperatures, so its best to bring it inside for autumn and winter, then put it back out when the sun reappears.Citrus plants are mildly toxic to cats if eaten, but cats absolutely hate the smell of them so will typically leave them well alone. Depending on the time of year, your tree may arrive without fruit, but if you give it enough warmth and sun it should flower and fruit from spring.\n\nThe Philippines exports around 190,000 tons of citrus calamondin juice every year."]

A native of the Eastern Cape of South Africa, this cute little plant usually grows at quite high altitude, which make it pretty tolerant of chilly temperatures.Growing in the wild to a maximum height of 50cm, it has chubby green leaves covered in tiny hairs. They look like little pickles, hence the name. In warm months, small yellow flowers might appear among the leaves (don’t be too disappointed if yours doesn’t bloom. It’s less common indoors).It’s very easy to look after. It likes a lot of light, but manages in light shade. Its water needs are low, so just top it up lightly when the soil is fully dry. In spring and summer, give it a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser to help it grow (make sure to use fertiliser made for succulents). And delicious as it may look, don’t be tempted to eat it. It’s not toxic, but it won’t taste great.\n\nThe botanical name delosperma echinatum means ‘prickly visible seed’. ‘Visible seed’ because its seeds are exposed when it fruits; ‘prickly’ because, well, look at it."]

The flowers are tiny little things on the spike in the middle of the spathe. A useful way to think about how to care for your plant is to consider where it comes from. Anthurium adreanum lives in rainforests, either in the branches of larger trees or on the ground beneath them. That means it’s used to getting dappled light, rather than direct sun, and regularly getting soaked by rainfall.In a home, that means giving it indirect light and making sure its soil is kept lightly moist. You'll help it grow, and encourage flowers, by feeding it with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.\n\nThere are over 1,000 different varieties of anthurium.

It will also benefit from a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser in spring and summer. Low-key as it is, the snake plant is treasured all over the world.

The mix of sweetness and bitterness makes it a cooking ingredient with many uses. Even if you don’t eat it, as a plant it’s really lovely. Its leaves are a deep glossy green and in spring it will be covered in sweet-smelling blossom, which gives way to cute little fruits, about an inch long. The fruit should ripen through summer and they’re ready to eat when their skins turn deep orange. Native to China, it was brought to Europe in the 1800s and has been popular ever since. A kumquat tree would be a prized plant in a Victorian conservatory. Like all citrus trees, the kumquat needs a lot of sun, enough water to keep its soil consistently moist, and regular feeding. This is a tough plant and can withstand colder temperatures than the lemon or lime, but it will still need to come inside over winter. Temperatures below about 7 degrees can cause serious damage. As it grows you may want to prune it to help it keep its shape. It’s best to do this after you’ve picked off any fruit, so it can put its energy into new growth rather than the fruit. And it’s a great excuse to use all that fruit. Depending on the time of year, your tree may arrive without fruit, but if you give it enough warmth and sun it should flower and fruit from spring.\n\n In Cantonese, kumquat means ‘golden mandarin orange’."]

It rarely needs water, it can cope with direct sun and it never needs misting. It’s a dream of a plant if you like spectacular looks and minimal effort.The reason it’s so easy to look after is that it’s not actually a palm. It’s a type of succulent that happens to look like a palm. Succulents store water, because they’re used to dry weather. The ponytail palm stores water in its thick trunk, meaning it can go a really long time without a drink. That’s particularly useful in its native habitat, Mexico, where drought is common. For you, it just means you can be a forgetful waterer without worrying.It’s used to growing in forests, so it will manage in light shade, but it’s much happier in bright light. It will even take full sun. This is an ideal plant for those spots that others find too hot.\n\nThe ponytail palm can live an incredibly long time. There are some in Mexico that are known to be at least 350 years old."]

It loves to be somewhere bright but it doesn’t need watering very often.Hoyas are also known as ‘wax plant’ because of the slightly waxy feel of their leaves and flowers. Like most hoyas, this is a vine, which means it will grow long stems, so either let them dangle or give them something to climb up. Or if you prefer to keep your plant compact, just snip the stems back to the length you want. It won’t mind. Most hoyas come from places where the air is hot and humid. This one comes from the Philippines. Try to mimic those conditions at home. Put it in the sunniest spot possible and keep the air around it moist. That means either putting it in a bathroom or giving it a mist every few days. Give it a feed once per month in spring and summer. If you keep it really happy it might produce flowers, which are only tiny but smell of butterscotch.\n\nThere are about 300 different species of hoya."]

Its tall, dense growth makes it a good choice for anywhere you want a bit of impact. In the wild, this tree can become absolutely enormous, reaching a height of around 30 metres and as much as 200 metres in diameter. It grows all across India – in fact, it’s the national tree of India – and it’s valued for the shade its giant canopy provides in the extreme heat.It’s sometimes rather gruesomely known as strangling fig because in the wild it begins its life growing in the branches of large trees. Gradually, it wraps itself around its host, until eventually it envelops it completely. Don’t worry, it won’t try to strangle any of your other plants.It’s very easy to care for as a houseplant. It likes its soil to remain quite dry, so let it dry out almost completely, then give it a really good soak. Let any excess water drain off so it doesn’t sit in water. It likes quite a bright room, but isn’t keen on direct sun, which can burn its leaves. It can grow quite quickly, especially if you give it a monthly feed in spring and summer. Please note: This plant's sap can be poisonous so keep it well away from pets and small children.\n\nIn Hindu mythology this plant is known as ‘the wish-fulfilling tree’.

It grows up in the branches of large trees, which is how it gets the name bird’s nest fern. Plants that grow like this are known as epiphytes. A wild bird’s nest fern could grow as large as 3 metres across. You’ll be glad to know this one will get nowhere near that large, but it does like to feel as if it’s back in the forest. It will be happy in everything from medium light to quite shady spots. The thing bird's nest ferns really need is moisture, in its soil and the air. Water it whenever the top two inches of soil feel dry and give it a mist every few days. Even better, let it live in a bright bathroom.Because bird’s nest ferns grow from the centre, their outer leaves brown as they age. This is nothing to worry about. It’s just your plant making space for new growth. You can snip the brown leaves off. \n\nThis plant is a protected species in Hong Kong, so deserves to be treated with great respect."]

Instead of the usual flat leaves, it has long cylindrical leaves, hence the name sansevieria cylindrica. The reason snake plants need so little care is because they come from places where the weather is hot and dry, mostly in parts of Africa and Asia. Their hard leaves let almost no water evaporate, even sealing their pores during the day to keep everything in. In the wild they may only get rain every few months, so forgetting to water yours for a while won’t bother it at all. The only thing you really need to remember is not to overwater. It’s the one thing they hate. Be very light with the watering. Your plant won’t like suddenly being soaked after a long period without water. It can shock it and cause leaf and root damage. A very small amount once or twice a month – even less in winter – is all that’s needed.\n\nThe tallest varieties of snake plant can grow up to 2 metres tall."]

Our climate may not have Mediterranean warmth but varieties like this one, ‘Perretta’, can deal with cold weather and will produce plenty of fruit. We advise keeping this tree in a pot, which will restrict its growth to about a maximum of 2 metres. If you plant it in the ground be prepared for it to grow up to 4 metres.Fig trees are an investment. You’re unlikely to get fruit the first year, but take care of them and they’ll reward you with fruit ever after.For the happiest possible tree, put yours somewhere sunny and sheltered from harsh winds. Water regularly so the soil stays moist and feed weekly in spring and summer. Unlike most fruit trees, the fig doesn’t grow flowers before it fruits. The fruit grows straight from the branch and the flowers are actually inside the fruit. That’s why they’re so strikingly pink inside. Fruit should be ready to harvest by late summer/early autumn. It’s ready when it feels soft and comes off the branch easily.Keep your tree healthy by pruning it once per year, in late winter. Just snip off any weak or broken growth and give it a tidy up until it’s the shape you want. Don’t leave it too late to prune. Pruning in spring can cause your tree to lose a lot of sap, which would weaken it. You wouldn’t want to stop it making all that lovely fruit.\n\nFigs are one of the most ancient fruits. Fig fossils have been found that are around 20 million years old."]

It does best in a sunny spot and likes its soil to be kept moist, although make sure excess water can drain from the bottom of the pot. Give it a weekly feed in spring and summer, to give it lots of nutrients to put into flowers. After the flowers will come black and purple berries.New leaves will be a rich bronze, gradually turning green as they age. It might lose a lot of its leaves in very cold winters, but will replace them with new foliage in spring. For best results, cut back any untidy or dead growth. That will lead to healthier growth next spring and even more flowers. It will grow up to 10 metres if you let it, but it’s easy to chop it back to the size you want."]

In the wild they grow in woods, so they’re used to living in shady spots underneath large trees. They’ve been popular houseplants since the 1800s because of their easy-going nature. They like their soil to be kept moist and they’ll let you know when they’re thirsty. The leaves will start to flop but perk right back up after a drink. Chinese evergreens come in lots of different patterns and colours – check out our full family – so if you don’t have bright rooms but want plants with impact, these are the ones for you. They’re perfect as office plants too.\n\nIn China, this plant is considered a good luck charm, so maybe you should carry one around with you at all times."]

Its simple, striped leaves make a stylish backdrop for flowering plants. Or you can arrange it with other grasses for a low-effort display that will fill your garden or balcony with the soft sound of wind rustling through leaves.Originally from Japan, carex is incredibly easy to look after. It likes moist soil, so be sure to keep it regularly topped up, but other than that there’s little it needs. It’s evergreen, so will give you subtle colour all year round, including some modest brown flowers in summer. Once a year, give it a brush through with your hands to remove old, dead growth. \n\n Fossils of carex fruits from the Miocene era have been found in Denmark, meaning this plant has existed in some form for at least 15 million years."]

Make sure excess water can drain from the bottom of its pot and, if possible, shelter it from rain and strong wind in winter. Left alone for long enough it will eventually grow into a large tree, about 4.5 metres tall. That would take many decades though as it grows very slowly. Yours will stay roughly its current size for several years. It will manage perfectly well if left alone but you can help it grow by giving it a feed once per month in spring and summer, and keep it neat by removing dead or broken leaves in early summer.

She blooms in midsummer and tends to stay in flower for 3-4 weeks; after her buds open, trim off a bunch of her stalks and use them in essential oils for some aromatherapy action, or in tea as a sleep aid."]

They have a long flowering period, usually all through summer and into early autumn, so an easy way to add colour to your garden or balcony. Choose from pink, yellow, purple or orange – or mix them up for a riot of colour. Gerberas come from South Africa, where they bask in hot sun and mostly dry weather. We may not have South African weather in the UK but you can make gerberas happy by planting them in full sun and sheltering them from heavy rain. They like their soil to stay moist, but make sure excess water can drain off as they don’t like being waterlogged. Water the soil rather than pouring it over the plant. The flowers are fragile and you wouldn’t want to break them.Gerberas are great for indoor flower arrangements. Cut flowers off whenever you like and they’ll be replaced with new ones. Wilted flowers should also be removed to make way for new ones (this is called deadheading). It’s a good idea to feed once every few weeks in spring and summer. No need for more than that.Not all gerberas survive cold winters but this one should. If possible, put it somewhere sheltered so it doesn’t get waterlogged by heavy rain or snow. Then move it back into full sun in spring and wait for the return of those flowers. \n\nThe gerbera is the fifth most popular cut flower in the world. The only flowers used more are rose, carnation, chrysanthemum and tulip."]

There are many hundreds of different varieties of this plant, all in different shades and all with compact, multi-lobed leaves. The botanical name acer palmatum means ‘hand-like maple’. This variety is one of the most handsome, with leaves a deep autumnal red. New leaves will be green, then turn to more fiery tones as the year progresses.The Japanese maple doesn’t just grow in Japan. You’ll also find it across other parts of south-east Asia, as well as Russia. In the wild, it will often be found in growing in the dappled light under larger trees. It likes similar conditions when grown outside in the UK. It likes living in quite a bright spot, but avoid putting it somewhere that gets harsh midday sun. Its leaves might scorch if the sun is too strong. Early morning or late afternoon sun would be ideal.Water it regularly, whenever the top two inches of soil feel dry, but don't be tempted to overdo it, as it doesn't like sitting in very wet soil. It needs to be able to drain freely.Please be aware that it will shed its lovely leaves in winter, so it can put all its energy into producing even more foliage when spring comes again. This is a plant that will look better and better every year.Your plant will arrive in a nursery pot with drainage holes in the bottom. You don't need to remove it from this pot. You can just pop it inside a decorative outdoor pot of your choice.\n\nIn Japan, there’s a long established tradition of going to see Japanese maples when their leaves are at their reddest, in autumn. There’s even a word for it, momijigari, meaning ‘red leaf hunt’."]

        "aboutText": ["There are over 500 varieties of campanula, from tiny to tall, but they all have one thing in common: gorgeous purple flowers. They look a bit like bluebells with the colour turned up. The name campanula actually means ‘little bell’ in Latin. Campanulas may look delicate but they’re tough little things, able to grow in pretty harsh conditions and the oddest of places. You may well have spotted them growing in cracks in brick walls or on the side of the road, their sweet blooms cheering up even the bleakest spots. They can cope with extreme cold, dry spells and wind.Their hardy nature means they’re really easy plants to grow. They don’t like shade (it will stop them producing flowers), but otherwise they’re very unfussy. They should flower throughout summer and sometimes into autumn. A feed every couple of weeks will give them a nutrient boost.This variety has a habit of spreading as far as you’ll let it. It’s easy to contain in a pot, but if you plant it in the ground be prepared for it to travel around the garden. This is of course not necessarily a bad thing. Who wouldn’t want more of those flowers?"]

It was introduced to the UK in the early 1700s and has been popular ever since. Hydrangea macrophylla is the archetypal hydrangea, with a compact shape and lots of big round flower clusters.An amazing thing about the hydrangea is its flowers change colour depending on the acidity of the soil. Acidic soil results in bluer flowers, while alkaline soil results in more pinkish flowers. Hydrangea flowers start to appear in early summer and should give your outdoor space colour and a spicy scent through to autumn, long after a lot of other flowers have faded. You might expect such a spectacular plant to be complicated to care for, it’s super low-maintenance. Keep it well watered and fed throughout the growing season, then give it a good prune back in late autumn and you should see an explosion of flowers year after year. \n\nIn Japan, the leaves of hydrangea macrophylla are fermented to make a drink called amacha."]

It makes sense when you see it in flower, as you hopefully will if you give your plant the right conditions. The bright red flowers emerge from little tubes between December and April, so they look like lipsticks twisting out of their holders. You should see flowers if you put your plant somewhere that gets a good amount of bright light, but not direct sunlight. Keep its soil lightly moist and give it a regular squirt with a mister. It’s also a good idea to feed it once per month in spring and summer. Follow those instructions and you should see lots of flowers. Even when it’s not in flower, this plant is a beauty, whether it’s a hanging plant or cascading its bright green leaves from a high shelf.\n\nMost lipstick plants are pollinated not by bees but by stunning sunbirds.

This variety has long stems that look fantastic tumbling from shelves or hanging pots.A native of Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, it’s become a popular houseplant all over the world because it’s very easy to care for (bright light; regular watering; done). In spring and summer, give it a feed with liquid fertiliser to help it grow big(ish) and strong. If you ever want to trim those long stems, just snip them back with shears or clean scissors.It will sometimes flower, but oddly they’re far less interesting than the leaves. They’re tiny little white blooms in the centre of the plant. The flowers are how this plant gets its popular name, Moses-in-the-cradle. The blossoms look like babies being cradled in the boat-like leaves (sort of)."]

        "aboutText": ["Almost all plants absolutely love to be bathed in soft light all day. Sitting on a windowsill will give them plenty of sun to help them grow. All these plants are light lovers and generally pretty easy to look after. One thing to be aware of: If your window is south-facing, the sun may be very strong in the middle of the day in summer. If you notice any of your plants getting brown, dry marks you may want to move them to a less bright windowsill.The set without pots includes:Emma – Tradescantia nanouk’s tumbling purple leaves make her an easy way to add colour to a room. She grows fast, so let her stems dangle gently off the windowsill or give her a trim to keep a bushy shape.Fidel – The fiddle leaf fig is one of the most popular houseplants due to its huge, fiddle-shaped leaves. Looked after well, this one can eventually grow into a handsome tree. Xena – She’s commonly known as the pickle plant because of her cute little leaves that look like pickles. She very rarely needs watering. Only give her a drink when her leaves look a little deflated.Suri – Suri is a succulent. The main thing to know about succulents is they’re incredibly easy to look after. They store lots of water in those fleshy leaves, so hardly ever need a drink.Spike – This cactus couldn’t be more straightforward to look after. He’ll take as much sun as you can give him and only needs water when his soil is totally dry. He’s prickly, so keep him away from pets and children.The set with pots also includes:Concrete pots - Clean design and honest materials. That’s what these minimalist concrete pots are all about. When the design is this simple, the finish has to be perfect. They're exclusive to Patch.Fractured pots - Layers of glaze give this luxurious pot its distinctive texture.

Introduced to the UK in the late 1800s, it’s become a very popular small indoor plant because it’s so low-maintenance, suitable for homes or offices.The name aglaonema is derived from the Greek ‘Aglos’, meaning bright, and ‘nema’, meaning thread, because of those variegated patterns on its leaves. There are a huge number of different varieties and colours (check out Anna our silver version).It’s a cinch to care for. It needs very little water and is happy to live in most light conditions. As with most brightly coloured plants, you’ll notice its foliage is brighter if it gets more light. And when it gets the right amount of light it is spectacular. You'll see even more spectacular growth if you give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. \n\nIn China, the Chinese evergreen is considered a lucky plant. Who knows if it works, but worth a try, right?"]

        "aboutText": ["A lemon tree is a great way to bring some colour to your patio or balcony. Lemon trees now grow all over the world, but it’s thought that it originated in India. It was introduced to Europe by those ever industrious ancient Romans and has been a popular indoor and outdoor plant for centuries. There aren’t many citrus trees that will produce fruit in a typical British climate, but a lemon tree that’s well looked after will fruit until early autumn. Don't be alarmed if the fruit is green. It will ripen after some time in the sun. Not every fruit will reach full maturity, as the plant will put its energy into just a few at a time. When a lemon looks yellow, plump and ripe, cut it off, so you can enjoy it and your tree can get on with growing more.It requires relatively little care. Keep its soil lightly moist, feed it once per month in spring and summer, and prune it lightly each year to keep a bushy shape. Remember this is a sun-loving plant, so it won’t enjoy being out in really cold winter temperatures (it's not keen on anything below about 10°C). Bring it inside for winter, until the weather gets nice and warm, probably in about May or June.Depending on the time of year, your tree may arrive without fruit, but if you give it enough warmth and sun it should flower and fruit from spring. Your plant will arrive in a nursery pot (the plastic pot it’s been growing in). There’s no need to remove it from this. Just place the whole thing inside a decorative pot. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. \n\n19.4 million tonnes of lemons are produced around the world each year."]

And, yes, you can use her leaves in cooking. She’s easy to care for. Give her a spot that gets sun for at least part of the day and keep her soil moist. Keep a closer eye on her in summer as she can dry out fast in hot temperatures. If you see her leaves getting brown, she’s letting you know she’s thirsty. The set with pots includes:Two Fibrestone cylinder pots - Made of tough but quite lightweight fibrestone, this pot is built to last years and can be left outside through all seasons.

Always make sure excess water can drain out of the bottom of the pot.Citrus trees can be damaged by very cold temperatures, so it’s best to bring it inside for autumn and winter, then put it back out when the weather warms up.

It’s unlikely to bear fruit in the first year, but take care of it and you’ll be rewarded from next year on.Blueberries originate from North America and this species is mainly found growing on forest floors or near swamps. That means it likes its soil moist (but not soggy, please). Water it regularly and never let it dry out. Water it more often when it’s fruiting, as those juicy berries need a lot of moisture. Once a month, add some liquid fertiliser to give it a good feed.Little white flowers will appear before the berries start forming. Berries will gradually turn from green to that familiar dusty blue. When they look like this they’re ready to pick. They freeze really well, if you find you’re growing them faster than you can eat them. \n\nLong ago, whalers in New England would use blueberries to dye their clothes.

Wild trees can grow almost 20 metres tall, but they’d take around 50 years to reach that height. The popular name cabbage tree is thought to be due to the fact that its leaves used to be eaten and were said to have a cabbage-like flavour. We absolutely do not recommend eating it, whatever your feelings on cabbage. Instead, it should be enjoyed as a really easy, attractive garden plant. Available in either red or green, it looks handsome potted up on a patio or balcony, but you can also plant it directly in the ground. It likes a spot that gets at least a few hours of sun and prefers to be kept sheltered from cold winter winds. Beyond that, it’s very undemanding, just asking that you water it every now and again. \n\nMaori used to use the strong cordyline fibres to make everything from fishing line to baskets to shoes."]

Hydrangea macrophylla is the archetypal hydrangea, with a compact shape and lots of big round flower clusters.An amazing thing about the hydrangea is its flowers change colour depending on the acidity of the soil. Acidic soil results in bluer flowers, while alkaline soil results in more pinkish flowers. Hydrangea flowers start to appear in early summer and should give your outdoor space colour and a spicy scent through to autumn, long after a lot of other flowers have faded. You might expect such a spectacular plant to be complicated to care for, it’s super low-maintenance. Keep it well watered and fed throughout the growing season, then give it a good prune back in late autumn and you should see an explosion of flowers year after year.\n\nIn Japan, the leaves of hydrangea macrophylla are fermented to make a drink called amacha."]

        "aboutText": ["The Japanese maple, or acer, is a fantastic way to easily introduce colour to your patio or balcony. There are many hundreds of different varieties of this plant, all in different shades and all with compact, multi-lobed leaves. The botanical name acer palmatum means ‘hand-like maple’. This variety is one of the most handsome, with leaves a deep autumnal red. New leaves will be green, then turn to more fiery tones as the year progresses.The Japanese maple doesn’t just grow in Japan. You’ll also find it across other parts of south-east Asia, as well as Russia. In the wild, it will often be found in growing in the dappled light under larger trees. It likes similar conditions when grown outside in the UK. It likes living in quite a bright spot, but avoid putting it somewhere that gets harsh midday sun. Its leaves might scorch if the sun is too strong. Early morning or late afternoon sun would be ideal.Water it regularly, whenever the top two inches of soil feel dry, but don't be tempted to overdo it, as it doesn't like sitting in very wet soil. It needs to be able to drain freely.Please be aware that it will shed its lovely leaves in winter, so it can put all its energy into producing even more foliage when spring comes again. This is a plant that will look better and better every year.Your plant will arrive in a nursery pot with drainage holes in the bottom. You don't need to remove it from this pot. You can just pop it inside a decorative outdoor pot of your choice.\n\nIn Japan, there’s a long established tradition of going to see Japanese maples when their leaves are at their reddest, in autumn. There’s even a word for it, momijigari, meaning ‘red leaf hunt’."]

We may not have South African weather in the UK but you can make gerberas happy by planting them in full sun and sheltering them from heavy rain. They like their soil to stay moist, but make sure excess water can drain off as they don’t like being waterlogged. Water the soil rather than pouring it over the plant. The flowers are fragile and you wouldn’t want to break them.Gerberas are great for indoor flower arrangements. Cut flowers off whenever you like and they’ll be replaced with new ones. Wilted flowers should also be removed to make way for new ones (this is called deadheading). It’s a good idea to feed once every few weeks in spring and summer. No need for more than that.Not all gerberas survive cold winters but this one should. If possible, put it somewhere sheltered so it doesn’t get waterlogged by heavy rain or snow. Then move it back into full sun in spring and wait for the return of those flowers. \n\nThe gerbera is the fifth most popular cut flower in the world.

It was introduced to the UK in the early 1700s and has been popular ever since. Hydrangea macrophylla is the archetypal hydrangea, with a compact shape and lots of big round flower clusters.An amazing thing about the hydrangea is its flowers change colour depending on the acidity of the soil. Acidic soil results in bluer flowers, while alkaline soil results in more pinkish flowers. Hydrangea flowers start to appear in early summer and should give your outdoor space colour and a spicy scent through to autumn, long after a lot of other flowers have faded. You might expect such a spectacular plant to be complicated to care for, it’s super low-maintenance. Keep it well watered and fed throughout the growing season, then give it a good prune back in late autumn and you should see an explosion of flowers year after year. \n\nIn Japan, the leaves of hydrangea macrophylla are fermented to make a drink called amacha."]

Wild trees can grow almost 20 metres tall, but they’d take around 50 years to reach that height. The popular name cabbage tree is thought to be due to the fact that its leaves used to be eaten and were said to have a cabbage-like flavour. We absolutely do not recommend eating it, whatever your feelings on cabbage. Instead, it should be enjoyed as a really easy, attractive garden plant. Available in either red or green, it looks handsome potted up on a patio or balcony, but you can also plant it directly in the ground. It likes a spot that gets at least a few hours of sun and prefers to be kept sheltered from cold winter winds. Beyond that, it’s very undemanding, just asking that you water it every now and again. \n\nMaori used to use the strong cordyline fibres to make everything from fishing line to baskets to shoes."]

        "aboutText": ["You get a lot of reward for very little effort with sedum. Sedums are sometimes known as stonecrop because they need about the same amount of care as stones: almost none. They need very little water and thrive in really hot spots where other plants would struggle. Most sedums are small but this one, sedum herbstfreude, grows up to 60cm tall. It’s a bit of a star of the sedum world. Its leaves are cute all year round and in autumn it explodes into colour with lots of flowers that turn from pale pink to deep pink, eventually fading to soft brown. The reason sedum plants need so little care is because they store water in those thick, fleshy leaves. Those water stores can get them through long periods of drought. In the wild, they’re mainly found in places where the weather is hot and dry. While there’s no real care required, beyond a bit of water if the soil gets completely dry and a yearly trim, feeding once at the beginning of spring will give it a nutrient boost for the growing season. Also, make sure excess water can drain from the bottom of the pot. It doesn’t like to be waterlogged. \n\nSedums were used as an easy source of food in some parts of Canada. We wouldn’t recommend eating them."]

As part of a flower collection or just on their own, they’ll look showstopping. They flower from about July to September. Agapanthus originate from South Africa, so they really enjoy sun. Put them in the brightest spot in your outdoor space, so they can soak up as many rays as possible. Water them frequently, so the soil remains moist, but make sure any excess can drain out of the bottom of the pot. They may need watering daily in really hot weather.While most plants love a bit of room in their pot for their roots to spread out, agapanthus love their roots constricted. Oddly, they actually flower more where their roots are tightly packed. If there’s too much soil around them they’ll usually just grow more leaves, but very few flowers. Remember this when it comes to dividing your plants in future years. Always a tight pot.\n\nThe name agapanthus means ‘love flower’ in Greek. It’s not hard to see why."]

        "aboutText": ["Succulents are the ideal beginner plant because they need almost no attention. The only thing they’re fussy on is light. They need to be somewhere bright, like a windowsill or anywhere close to a window or skylight. That’s their only big ask. You hardly ever have to water them and there’s no other upkeep involved. This set is made up of plants with a mix of colours and unusual shapes. They may be tiny but they have big personalities. Pots not included set includes:Mimi – Scientifically known as haworthia limifolia, she has triangular ridged leaves that earn her the amazing popular name of fairy’s washboard. Those fat leaves are full of water-holding gel. She won’t grow more than about 4” tall. If her leaf edges turn brown it means she’s getting too much sun and would like to move somewhere a bit less bright.Levi – Their scientific name is crassula arborescens, but they’re popularly known as the silver dollar plant, because of their thick, silvery, round leaves. This one will eventually grow quite large if you let it, but you can cut their stems back to keep them small. They may grow pink flowers in spring. Gabi – Gasteria is a relative of the classic houseplant aloe vera, but much much smaller. Her pretty pointed green leaves are speckled with pale dots. She almost never needs water so only give her a drink if her leaves start to wrinkle. She likes bright light but if her leaves turn yellow it means she’s getting too much sun. Lila – This little beauty is echeveria lilacina, or ghost echeveria, which grows pale grey-blue leaves in a striking rosette shape. Like the others, she likes lots of light and very little water. As she grows, her outer leaves may turn brown. This is nothing to worry about. She’s just getting rid of old growth to make way for new leaves, which grow from the centre. You can pick or snip off brown leaves. Pots included set includes: Mini clay pots, perfect for you mini succulents."]

There are over 150 different species, most of them epiphytes, which means they grow in nooks on trees or rocks, rather than on the ground. The name lipstick plant is probably confusing on first look. It makes sense when you see it in flower, as you hopefully will if you give your plant the right conditions. The bright red flowers emerge from little tubes from July to December, so they look like lipsticks twisting out of their holders.You should see flowers if you put your plant somewhere that gets a good amount of bright light, but not direct sunlight. Keep its soil lightly moist and give it a regular squirt with a mister. It’s also a good idea to feed it once per month in spring and summer. Follow those instructions and you should see lots of flowers. Even when it’s not in flower, this plant is a beauty, whether it’s a hanging plant or cascading its bright green leaves from a high shelf.\n\nMost lipstick plants are pollinated not by bees but by stunning sunbirds. You don’t get a lot of sunbirds in the wild in Britain, sadly."]
