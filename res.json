This indoor plant has stunning white-and-green variegation, but it’s also a cinch to look after. It can live happily in almost any light conditions and it rarely needs watering. It’s the perfect plant.Pothos are a family of beautiful vines that are popularly known as devil’s ivy. This is for two reasons, neither of them sinister. First, in the wild they thrive in dark places. Second, they’re almost impossible to kill. They’ll take a lot of neglect. Not that we’re suggesting you neglect them. While it will easily tolerate dry, shady conditions, it will be happiest if you water it whenever the top two inches of soil feel dry, put it somewhere bright, but out of direct sun, and give it a feed with liquid fertiliser once a month in spring and summer. Please note that its variegation will be less pronounced if it’s kept in a shady spot. It will still be a queen, but less obviously marble-y.\n\nGiven enough room to stretch out a pothos can grow up to 20 metres long."}]}
